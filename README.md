> React + Vite portfolio showcasing modular UI components, Tailwind styling & 3D experiments

---

## 📌 About
This is a personal portfolio project built with **React** and **Vite**, designed to practice and showcase frontend development skills.  
The project demonstrates component-based UI, animations, interactive elements, and small 3D/visual experiments.

> ⚠️ Note: I am **practicing only** these technologies — React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and basic 3D/animation (Three.js / canvas).

---

## ✨ Features
- Reusable UI components (`components/ui/*`)
- Dynamic sections: Hero, About, Projects, Skills, Contact, etc.
- Animated effects (grid, sparkles, tooltips, meteors)
- 3D globe and interactive visual elements
- Utility-first styling with Tailwind CSS
- Modular architecture and clean folder structure

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- ⚛️ **React.js** – Component-based frontend
- ⚡ **Vite** – Fast dev server and build tool
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework
- 🌐 **Three.js / Canvas** – For experimental 3D visuals
- 🧰 **Node.js & npm** – Development environment
